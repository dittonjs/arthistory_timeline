    description: "This is considered one of the most important panels of the Chauvet Cave. It contains twenty animals. The drama is clear to see, highlighted by the rhinoceroses confronting each other. This is unique in Palaeolithic cave art. The two rhinos were drawn at the same time, probably by the same artist. The charcoal used has been dated between approximately 30,000 and 32,000 years before present. The four horses heads were drawn in charcoal after the rhinos as well as the other animals - two more rhinos, a stag and two mammoths - on this panel, which as elsewhere in the cave had been prepared and scraped. Of the four horses, the top one was drawn first and the lowest one drawn last. The artist who drew the horses - almost certainly one artist - mixed the charcoal with the surface clay to obtain various hues and visual effects [shading and perspective]. The technique was stump-drawing, as well as scraping the outer edges of the images to highlight them with a pale aura.",

    description: "Discovered among a group of sacred implements ritually buried in a deposit within an early temple of the falcon god Horus at the site of Hierakonpolis (the capital of Egypt during the pre-dynastic period), this large ceremonial object is one of the most important artifacts from the dawn of Egyptian civilization. The beautifully carved palette, 63.5 cm (more than 2 feet) in height and made of smooth greyish-green siltstone, is decorated on both faces with detailed low relief. These scenes show a king, identified by name as Narmer, and a series of ambiguous scenes that have been difficult to interpret and have resulted in a number of theories regarding their meaning.",

    description: "Khafre Enthroned is a funerary statue of the Pharaoh Khafre, who reigned during the Fourth dynasty of ancient Egypt (c. 2570 BC). It is now located in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The construction is made of anorthosite gneiss, (related to diorite) a valuable, extremely hard, and dark stone brought 400 miles down the Nile River from royal quarries. This highlights Khafre’s importance and power as a ruler.[1] The statue was carved for the Pharaoh’s valley temple near the Great Sphinx, a part of the necropolis (a funerary city) used in funeral rituals. This Old Kingdom statue has an important function in Egyptian tombs as substitute abodes for the Pharaoh’s ka—the life force that accompanied a person with a kind of other self. After death, the ka leaves the body into the afterlife, but still needs a place to rest: the statue.[2]",

    description: "Quartzite sandstone naophorous statue of Sety II: seated on a throne, holding on his knees a shrine surmounted by a ram's head, emblem of the god Amun-Ra. Despite damage on the face of the ram and the head of the uraeus, this is one of the most complete sculptures from ancient Egypt. The king wears a shoulder-length wig with longer strands in front and a uraeus on the forehead. The pleated kilt is held by a large belt bearing a rhomboid decoration, from the back of which emerges a piece of pleated material. An animal tail, hanging between the legs and sandals, completes the royal attire. The narrow throne with low back is equipped, exceptionally, with a cushion, on which the king sits. The sides of the throne are decorated with the heraldic plants of Upper and Lower Egypt, bound together to symbolize the union of the Two Lands. These plants are generally placed to correspond with the direction of the statue and occupy the same position on each side. Here, however, their positions are inverted: on the throne's right side we find the papyrus near the back and the lotus near the front, while on the left side, we observe the contrary. In spite of the cushion, the seated attitude is rigid. The sculpture is static, with elongated proportions, a slender torso, and oversized limbs. The oval face, with full cheeks that fall heavily toward the broad chin, has a stern expression. On the wide forehead, the eyebrows, carved in relief, are arched and lengthened by tapering cosmetic bands. Similar lines, in shallow relief, frame the eyes. The straight nose surmounts a horizontal mouth with lips of equal length articulated by finely raised ridges and a small hollow at each corner. The head is set on a straight neck that is narrowed by the plunging flaps of the wig and, in profile, seems to disappear completely. Large, rounded shoulders, marked by converging grooves to indicate the deltoid muscle, dominate the torso. Two oblique ridges mark the clavicles, and a summary modeling renders the chest. The waist is thin, framed by massive arms and schematic hands with long, parallel fingers whose nails are depicted with care. The treatment of the elongated legs is more elaborate, with delicately modeled knees and well-defined muscle and bone structure. The well-sculptured feet are shown wearing sandals with pointed soles and thick straps in high relief. The royal names are engraved on the shoulders. There is a text on the statue's back. The royal titulary is also inscribed around the base.",

    description: `The Mask of Warka is unique in that it is the first accurate depiction of the human face. Previous attempts, like the Tell Brak Head were not anatomically accurate, and featured exaggerated noses and ears. At 21.2 centimetres (8.3 in) tall, the mask was most likely originally part of a whole, life sized statue, probably made of wood, with the exposed areas of "skin" (arms, hands, feet, and most obviously the head) being the only ones made of the much rarer white marble. The back of the head would have been enhanced with bitumen and then colored metal — most likely either gold leaf or copper. This combination would have then extended over the forehead in waves. This hairpiece would have been attached to the Mask with metal studs, which could possibly have been engraved. The hollowed out eyes and eyebrows bear traces of an ancient inlay, perhaps shell and lapis lazuli. Perforations at the ears indicate that the image once wore jewelry. Parts of the eyebrows and hair were also emphasized with colored inlays.`,

One side shows a war scene; a Sumerian army with wheeled waggons and infantry charges the enemy; prisoners are brought before a larger individual, who is accompanied by guards and has his own waggon waiting behind him. The reverse shows scenes of men are bringing animals, fish etc, possibly as booty or tribute; at the top the same large individual banquets with other men; they are entertained at the right by a singer and a man playing a lyre. The triangular end panels show other scenes; the object was found crushed but has since been restored, and samples retained.`,

Within Uruk, the greatest monument was the Anu Ziggurat on which the White Temple was built. Dating to the late 4th millennium B.C.E. (the Late Uruk Period, or Uruk III) and dedicated to the sky god Anu, this temple would have towered well above (approximately 40 feet) the flat plain of Uruk, and been visible from a great distance—even over the defensive walls of the city.`,

Many inscribed with his name and divine dedications survive. Here, Gudea is depicted in the seated pose of a ruler before his subjects, his hands folded in a traditional gesture of greeting and prayer. The Sumerian inscription on his robe lists the various temples that he built or renovated in Lagash and names the statue itself, "Gudea, the man who built the temple; may his life be long." `,
